# Othello
A school project in python.

Press on the dark gray outline that you want to lay on. The basic rules of the game is that you flip your opponents disc by joining your now laid disc with another one of yours in all directions. Corners are unflippable and therefore good, since you can build stable triangles from them. When the game is over, just press on the board to reset the game.
